Crystal Nodes (CN) is an addon for the 3D modelling & animation program [Blender](https://blender.org) that enables easy creation of crystals illustrations. CN is focused on providing tools for providing Crystallography illustrations and it is not (for now) a computational tool for calculating inorganic structures

## Features:

-   generic tools for creating basic grain forms:

    -   extended primitives:

        -   Octahedron

        -   Tetrahedron

        -   Dodecahendron

        -   Rombic Dodecahedron

        -   Tetrakis Hexahedron

    -   non isometric crystal system forms:

        -   tetragonal trapezohedron

        -   trigonal - tetragonal - hexagonal - dihexagonal

        -   ditrigonal

        -   rhombic tetragonal

        -   non iso ditetragonal

-   tools for instancing grains according to the most common growth patterns:

    -   Felted

    -   Foliated

    -   Granular

    -   Parallel

    -   Plumose

    -   Radiating

-   tools for:

    -   creating h k l planes
    -   extruding and faces mirroring
    -   translate according to bravais lattices
