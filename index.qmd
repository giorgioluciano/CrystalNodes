Crystal Nodes (CN) is an addon for the 3D modelling & animation program [Blender](https://blender.org) that enables easy creation of crystals illustrations. CN is focused on providing tools for drawing Crystallography illustrations and it is not (for now) a computational tool for calculating inorganic structures

## Features:

-   generic tools for creating a basic grain forms (extended primitives node and nodes for non isometric crystal system)

-   tools for instancing grains according to the most common growth pattern (radiating, plumose, parallel, granular, felted, foliated )

-   tools for creating h,k,l planes, extruding faces, mirroring faces and to instance objs according to Bravais translation
