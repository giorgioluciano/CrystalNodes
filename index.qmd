Crystal Nodes (CN) is an addon for the 3D modelling & animation program [Blender](https://blender.org) that enables easy creation of crystals illustrations.  CN is focused on providing tools for providing Crystallography illustrations and it is not (for now) a computational tool for calculating inorganic structures

## Features:

- generic tools for creating a basic grain form (extended primitives nodeand nodes for non isometric crystal system)

- tools for instancing grains according to the most common growth patter (radiating, plumose, parallel, granular, felted, foliated )

- tools for creating h,k,l planes, extruding faces, mirroring faces and to instance objs accoring to bravais translation
