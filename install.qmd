## Download

Download the latest bundled release from the [releases page](https://github.com/giorgioluciano/CrystalNodes/tree/main/CrystalNodes/releases). Don't download the GitHub repo itself, as this won't install inside of Blender.


::: callout-note
# Safari

When downloading on MacOS with Safari, it automatically unzips the file into a `MolecularNodes` folder. This is extremely unhelpful as Blender requires the `.zip` file to install the addon. Either download with a different browser, or compress the folder again to `MolecularNodes.zip`.

## Installing the Addon

### Windows Administrator

If you are unsing Blender Launcher https://dotbow.github.io/Blender-Launcher/ , just launch you favorite version of Blender and that's it
