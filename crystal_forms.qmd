The Crystallographic menu is subdivided in Isometric and Non Isometric forms

## Isometric:

![Isometric forms](images/cn-cf-isometric-menu-animated.gif)Select the Iso crystal form you would like to create. If you select more then one form you can apply the [modifier](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/modeling/modifiers/introduction.html "blender modifier introduction from docs.blender") and then separate the forms created by material (each form will be created with a different default material)

The following Non Isometric Crystal forms can be created via the following nodes

1.  tetragonal trapezohedron

2.  trigonal - tetragonal  - hexagonal - dihexagonal

3.  ditrigonal

4.  rhombic tetragonal

5.  non iso ditetragonal

All the nodes (except the tetragonal trapezohedron) have options for building the Prism, Pyramid or Dypiramid non Isometric forms.
